They do this by dividing the input into tokens, sequences of tokens, and even subword units of tokens, and mapping these to vectors of real numbers. These numerical representations are how the models interpret both the content and structure of the data they work with, and how they make predictions based on the data they've been trained on.\\n\\nThe architecture of LLMs can be broadly divided into three types of layers: the embedding layer, the transformer layer, and the prediction layer. The embedding layer maps the tokens in the input to numerical representations. The transformer layer performs a self-attention process that allows the model to compare and combine the representations of the different tokens in the input to create a new representation. The prediction layer takes the output from the transformer layer and produces the final output, which could be a vector of probabilities indicating the likelihood of different words following the input. \\n\\nLLMs excel at generating text, summarizing texts, and answering questions based on the patterns they've learned from the vast amounts of text they've been trained on. They're an impressive feat of modern AI, but base their insights and outputs around patterns in the text they've seen, so may not consider new ideas or contexts that aren't in their training data. \", index=None, likelihood=None, token_likelihoods=None, finish_reason='COMPLETE')] meta=ApiMeta(api_version=ApiMetaApiVersion(version='1', is_deprecated=None, is_experimental=None), billed_units=ApiMetaBilledUnits(input_tokens=8.0, output_tokens=295.0, search_units=None, classifications=None), tokens=None, warnings=None)\n"
